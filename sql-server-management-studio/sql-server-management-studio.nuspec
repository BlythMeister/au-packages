    <description>
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for accessing, configuring, managing, administering, and developing all components of SQL Server. SSMS combines a broad group of 
graphical tools with a number of rich script editors to provide developers and administrators of all skill levels access to SQL Server.  This release features improved compatibility with previous versions of SQL Server, 
a stand-alone web installer, and toast notifications within SSMS when new releases become available.

#### Version Number

This package is versioned using the published build number. The corresponding 'release number' is listed below in the Release Notes section.

#### Supported SQL Server versions

* This version of SSMS works with all [supported versions of SQL Server 2008 - SQL Server 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle?C2=1044) and provides the greatest level of support for working with the latest cloud features in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
* There is no explicit block for SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2005, but some features may not work properly.
* Additionally, SSMS 17.x can be installed side by side with SSMS 16.x or SQL Server 2014 SSMS and earlier. 

#### Supported Operating systems

This release of SSMS supports the following 64-bit platforms when used with the latest available service pack:
- Windows 10 (64-bit)
- Windows 8.1 (64-bit)
- Windows 8 (64-bit)
- Windows 7 (SP1) (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2016 *
- Windows Server 2012 R2 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2012 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit)

\* SSMS 17.X is based on the Visual Studio 2015 Isolated shell, which was released before Windows Server 2016. Microsoft takes app compatibility seriously and ensures that already-shipped applications continue to run on the latest Windows releases. To minimize issues running SSMS on Windows Server 2016, ensure SSMS has all of the latest updates applied. If you experience any issues with SSMS on Windows Server 2016, contact support. The support team determines if the issue is with SSMS, Visual Studio, or with Windows compatibility. The support team then routes the issue to the appropriate team for further investigation.	</description>

- Support for common management scenarios like:
   - Create and alter databases.
   - Backup and restore databases.
   - Importing, exporting, extracting and publishing Data-tier Applications.
   - Viewing and altering Server properties.
   - Full Object Explorer support.
   - Scripting database objects.
   - Support for SQL Agent jobs.
   - Support for Linked Servers.
- Learn more about Managed Instances [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/migrate-your-databases-to-a-fully-managed-service-with-azure-sql-database-managed-instance/).

(User suggestions [32911933](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32911933), and [32671051](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32671051).)

##### Bug fixes

**General SSMS**

Data Classification:

- Fixed an issue in *Data Classification* which was causing newly added classifications to be displayed with stale *information type* and *sensitivity label*.
- Fixed an issue where *Data Classification* was not working when targeting a server set to a case-sensitive collation.
		
Always On:

- Fixed an issue in AG Show Dashboard where clicking on *Collect Latency Data* could result in an error when the server was set to a case-sensitive collation.
- Fixed an issue where SSMS was incorrectly reporting an AG as *Distributed* when the Cluster service shuts down.
- Fixed an issue when creating AG using *Create Availability Group* dialog the *ReadOnlyRoutingUrl* is required.
- Fixed an issue when the primary is down and manually failover to secondary, a NullReferenceException will be thrown.
- Fixed an issue when creating Availability Group using backup/restore to initialize a database, on the secondary replicas, the database files will be created in the default directory. The fix includes:
   - Add the data/log directory validator.
   - Only do the file relocation when the replica is on a different OS to the primary replica.
- Fixed an issue where SSMS wizard doesn&apos;t generate *CLUSTER_TYPE* option, causing secondary join to fail.

Setup:
- Fixed issue where trying to upgrade SSMS by installing the &quot;upgrade package&quot; was failing when SSMS was installed in a non-default location.

SMO:
- Fixed performance issue where scripting tables on SQL Server 2016 and above could take up to 30 seconds (now, it&apos;s down to less than 1 second).

Object Explorer:
- Fixed an issue where SSMS could throw an exception like &quot;Object cannot be cast from DBNull to other types&quot; when trying to expand *Management* node in Object Explorer.
- Fixed an issue where *Start PowerShell* was not detecting the SQLServer module when user-defined PS profile emitted output.
- Fixed an intermittent hang that could occur when right-clicking a Table or Index node in Object Explorer.

Database Mail:
- Fixed an issue where *Database Mail Configuration Wizard* was throwing an exception when trying to display/manage more than 16 profiles.


**Analysis Services (AS)**

- Fixed as issue where modifying a data source on a 1400 compatibility level model in SSMS the changes are not saved to the server.
