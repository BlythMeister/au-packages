    <description>
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for accessing, configuring, managing, administering, and developing all components of SQL Server. SSMS combines a broad group of 
graphical tools with a number of rich script editors to provide developers and administrators of all skill levels access to SQL Server.  This release features improved compatibility with previous versions of SQL Server, 
a stand-alone web installer, and toast notifications within SSMS when new releases become available.

#### Version Number

This package is versioned using the published build number. The corresponding 'release number' is listed below in the Release Notes section.

#### Supported SQL Server versions

* This version of SSMS works with all [supported versions of SQL Server 2008 - SQL Server 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle?C2=1044) and provides the greatest level of support for working with the latest cloud features in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
* There is no explicit block for SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2005, but some features may not work properly.
* Additionally, SSMS 17.x can be installed side by side with SSMS 16.x or SQL Server 2014 SSMS and earlier. 

#### Supported Operating systems

This release of SSMS supports the following 64-bit platforms when used with the latest available service pack:
- Windows 10 (64-bit)
- Windows 8.1 (64-bit)
- Windows 8 (64-bit)
- Windows 7 (SP1) (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2016 *
- Windows Server 2012 R2 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2012 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit)

\* SSMS 17.X is based on the Visual Studio 2015 Isolated shell, which was released before Windows Server 2016. Microsoft takes app compatibility seriously and ensures that already-shipped applications continue to run on the latest Windows releases. To minimize issues running SSMS on Windows Server 2016, ensure SSMS has all of the latest updates applied. If you experience any issues with SSMS on Windows Server 2016, contact support. The support team determines if the issue is with SSMS, Visual Studio, or with Windows compatibility. The support team then routes the issue to the appropriate team for further investigation.	</description>

##### Known issues in this 17.3 release:

**General SSMS**

- The following SSMS functionality is not supported for Azure AD auth using UA with MFA:
   - Database Engine Tuning Advisor is not supported for Azure AD auth; there is a known issue where the error message presented to the user is a bit cryptic &quot;Could not load file or assembly &apos;Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory,…&quot; instead of the expected &quot;Database Engine Tuning Advisor does not support Microsoft Azure SQL Database. (DTAClient)&quot;.
- Trying to analyze a query in DTA results in an error: &quot;Object must implement IConvertible. (mscorlib)&quot;.
- *Regressed Queries* is missing from the Query Store list of reports in Object Explorer.
   - Workaround: Right-click the **Query Store** node and select **View Regressed Queries**.

**Integration Services (IS)**

- The [execution_path] in [catalog].[event_messagea] is not correct for package executions in Scale Out. The [execution_path] starts with “\Package” instead of the object name of the package executable. When viewing the overview report of package executions in SSMS, the link of “Execution Path” in Execution Overview cannot work. The workaround is to click “View Messages” on overview report to check all event messages.
