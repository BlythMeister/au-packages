    <description>
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for accessing, configuring, managing, administering, and developing all components of SQL Server. SSMS combines a broad group of 
graphical tools with a number of rich script editors to provide developers and administrators of all skill levels access to SQL Server.  This release features improved compatibility with previous versions of SQL Server, 
a stand-alone web installer, and toast notifications within SSMS when new releases become available.

#### Version Number

This package is versioned using the published build number. The corresponding 'release number' is listed below in the Release Notes section.

#### Supported SQL Server versions

* This version of SSMS works with all [supported versions of SQL Server 2008 - SQL Server 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle?C2=1044) and provides the greatest level of support for working with the latest cloud features in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
* There is no explicit block for SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2005, but some features may not work properly.
* Additionally, SSMS 17.x can be installed side by side with SSMS 16.x or SQL Server 2014 SSMS and earlier. 

#### Supported Operating systems

This release of SSMS supports the following 64-bit platforms when used with the latest available service pack:
- Windows 10 (64-bit)
- Windows 8.1 (64-bit)
- Windows 8 (64-bit)
- Windows 7 (SP1) (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2016 *
- Windows Server 2012 R2 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2012 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit)

\* SSMS 17.X is based on the Visual Studio 2015 Isolated shell, which was released before Windows Server 2016. Microsoft takes app compatibility seriously and ensures that already-shipped applications continue to run on the latest Windows releases. To minimize issues running SSMS on Windows Server 2016, ensure SSMS has all of the latest updates applied. If you experience any issues with SSMS on Windows Server 2016, contact support. The support team determines if the issue is with SSMS, Visual Studio, or with Windows compatibility. The support team then routes the issue to the appropriate team for further investigation.	</description>

#### [SSMS 17.5](download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md)

Generally available | Build number: 14.0.17224.0

##### What&apos;s new

**General SSMS**

Data Discovery &amp; Classification:

- Added a new SQL Data Discovery &amp; Classification feature for discovering, classifying, labeling &amp; reporting sensitive data in your databases. 
- Auto-discovering and classifying your most sensitive data (business, financial, healthcare, PII, etc.) can play a pivotal role in your organizational information protection stature.
- Learn more at [SQL Data Discovery &amp; Classification](../relational-databases/security/sql-data-discovery-and-classification.md).

Query Editor:

- Added support for SkipRows option to the Delimited Text External File Format for Azure SQL DW. This capability allows users to skip a specified number of rows when loading delimited text files into SQL DW. Also added the corresponding intellisense/SMO support for the FIRST_ROW keyword. 

Showplan:

- Enabled display of estimated plan button for SQL Data Warehouse
- Added new showplan attribute *EstimateRowsWithoutRowGoal*; and added new showplan attributes to *QueryTimeStats*: *UdfCpuTime* and *UdfElapsedTime*. For more information, see [Optimizer row goal information in query execution plan added in SQL Server 2017 CU3](http://support.microsoft.com/help/4051361).



##### Bug fixes

**General SSMS**

Showplan:

- Fixed Live Query Statistics elapsed time, to show engine execution time instead of time elapsed for LQS connection.
- Fixed an issue where showplan was not able to recognize Apply logical operators like GbApply and InnerApply.
- Fixed an issue related to ExchangeSpill.

Query Editor:

- Fixed on issue related to SPIDs where SSMS could throw an error like &quot;Input string was not in a correct format. (mscorlib)&quot; when executing a simple query preceded by a &quot;SET SHOWPLAN_ALL ON&quot;. 


SMO:

- Fixed an issue where SMO was not able to fetch AvailabilityReplica properties in case the server collation happened to be case-sensitive (as a result, SSMS could display an error message like &quot;The multi-part identifier &quot;a.delimited&quot; could not be bound.&quot;
- Fixed an issue in DatabaseScopedConfigurationCollection class, where incorrectly handling collations (as a result, an SSMS running on an ma machine with a Turkish locale could display an error like &quot;legacy cardinality estimation is not valid scoped configuration&quot; when right clicking on a database running on a server with a case-sensitive collation).
- Fixed an issue in JobServer class, where SMO was not able to fetch SQL Agent properties on a SQL 2005 server (as a result, SSMS was throwing an error like &quot;Cannot assign a default value to a local variable. Must declare the scalar variable &quot;@ServiceStartMode&quot; and, ultimately, was not displaying the SQL Agent node in Object Explorer).

Templates: 

- &quot;Database Mail&quot;: fixed a couple of typos [(https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035/suggestions/33143512)](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035/suggestions/33143512).  

Object Explorer:
- Fixed an issue where Managed Compression would fail for indexes (https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32610058-ssms-17-4-error-when-enabling-page-compression-o).

Auditing:
- Fixed an issue with the *Merge Audit Files* feature.
&lt;br&gt;

##### Known issues

Data classification:
- Removing a classification and then manually adding a new classification for the same column results in the old information type and sensitivity label being assigned to the column in the main view.&lt;br&gt;
*Workaround*: Assign the new information type and sensitivity label after the classification was added back to the main view and before saving.
