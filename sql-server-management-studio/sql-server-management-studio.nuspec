    <description>
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for accessing, configuring, managing, administering, and developing all components of SQL Server. SSMS combines a broad group of 
graphical tools with a number of rich script editors to provide developers and administrators of all skill levels access to SQL Server.  This release features improved compatibility with previous versions of SQL Server, 
a stand-alone web installer, and toast notifications within SSMS when new releases become available.

#### Version Number

This package is versioned using the published build number. The corresponding 'release number' is listed below in the Release Notes section.

#### Supported SQL Server versions

* This version of SSMS works with all [supported versions of SQL Server 2008 - SQL Server 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle?C2=1044) and provides the greatest level of support for working with the latest cloud features in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
* There is no explicit block for SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2005, but some features may not work properly.
* Additionally, SSMS 17.x can be installed side by side with SSMS 16.x or SQL Server 2014 SSMS and earlier. 

#### Supported Operating systems

This release of SSMS supports the following 64-bit platforms when used with the latest available service pack:
- Windows 10 (64-bit)
- Windows 8.1 (64-bit)
- Windows 8 (64-bit)
- Windows 7 (SP1) (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2016 *
- Windows Server 2012 R2 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2012 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit)

\* SSMS 17.X is based on the Visual Studio 2015 Isolated shell, which was released before Windows Server 2016. Microsoft takes app compatibility seriously and ensures that already-shipped applications continue to run on the latest Windows releases. To minimize issues running SSMS on Windows Server 2016, ensure SSMS has all of the latest updates applied. If you experience any issues with SSMS on Windows Server 2016, contact support. The support team determines if the issue is with SSMS, Visual Studio, or with Windows compatibility. The support team then routes the issue to the appropriate team for further investigation.	</description>
    <releaseNotes>
#### [SSMS 17.8.1](download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md)
*A bug was discovered in 17.8 related to provisioning SQL databases, so SSMS 17.8.1 replaces 17.8.*


Build number: 14.0.17277.0&lt;br&gt;
Release date: June 26, 2018


##### What&apos;s new

**General SSMS**

Database Properties:

- This improvement exposes the **AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES** configuration option for Filegroups. This new config option is added under the Database Properties &gt; Filegroups window in the form of a new column (Autogrow All Files) of checkboxes for each available Filegroup (except for Filestream and Memory Optimized Filegroups). The user can enable/disable AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES for a particular Filegroup by toggling the corresponding Autogrow_All_Files checkbox. Correspondingly, the **AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES** option is properly scripted when scripting the database for CREATE / generating scripts for the database (SQL2016 and above).
	
SQL Editor:

- Improved experience with Intellisense in Azure SQL Database when the user doesn&apos;t have master access.

Scripting:

- General performance improvements, especially over high-latency connections.
	
**Analysis Servics (AS)**

- Analysis Services client libraries and data providers updated to the latest version, which added support for the new Azure Government AAD authority (login.microsoftonline.us).



##### Bug fixes

**General SSMS**
	
Maintenance Plans:

- Fixed an issue when editing maintenance plans with Sql Authentication where &quot;Notify Operator Task&quot; was failing when using SQL authentication.
	
Scripting:

- Fixed an issue where PostProcess actions in SMO lead to resource exhaustion and SQL login failures
	
SMO:

- Fixed an issue where Table.Alter() fails if adding a column with a default constraint and the table already has data. For details, see [sql server smo generating inline default constraint when adding a column to a table containing data](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32895625).
	
Always Encrypted:

- Fixed an issue (in DacFx) which was causing a lock timeout error when enabling Always Encrypted on a partitioned table
	

**Analysis Services (AS)**

- Fixed an issue that occurred when modifying an OAuth datasource in a Tabular Analysis Services 1400-level compatibility model, which caused the changes in the OAuth tokens to not get updated in the data source.
- Fixed a crash in SSMS that may have occurred when using some invalid data source credentials or editing data sources that didn&apos;t support Change Data Source migration in Power Query (for example, Oracle) in Analysis Services Tabular 1400-level compatibility models.


##### Known issues

- Clicking the *Script* button after modifying any filegroup property in the *Properties* window, generates two scripts – one script with a *USE &lt;database&gt;* statement, and a second script with a *USE master* statement.  The script with *USE master* is generated in error and should be discarded. Run the script that contains the *USE &lt;database&gt;* statement.
- Some dialogs display an invalid edition error when working with new *General Purpose* or *Business Critical* Azure SQL Database editions.
- Some latency in XEvents viewer may be observed. This is a [known issue in the .Net Framework](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net472/dotnet472-changes.md#sql). Please, consider upgrading to NetFx 4.7.2.
