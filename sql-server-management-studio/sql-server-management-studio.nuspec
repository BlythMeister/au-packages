    <description>
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for accessing, configuring, managing, administering, and developing all components of SQL Server. SSMS combines a broad group of 
graphical tools with a number of rich script editors to provide developers and administrators of all skill levels access to SQL Server.  This release features improved compatibility with previous versions of SQL Server, 
a stand-alone web installer, and toast notifications within SSMS when new releases become available.

#### Version Number

This package is versioned using the published build number. The corresponding 'release number' is listed below in the Release Notes section.

#### Supported SQL Server versions

* This version of SSMS works with all [supported versions of SQL Server 2008 - SQL Server 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle?C2=1044) and provides the greatest level of support for working with the latest cloud features in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
* There is no explicit block for SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2005, but some features may not work properly.
* Additionally, SSMS 17.x can be installed side by side with SSMS 16.x or SQL Server 2014 SSMS and earlier. 

#### Supported Operating systems

This release of SSMS supports the following 64-bit platforms when used with the latest available service pack:
- Windows 10 (64-bit)
- Windows 8.1 (64-bit)
- Windows 8 (64-bit)
- Windows 7 (SP1) (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2016 *
- Windows Server 2012 R2 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2012 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit)

\* SSMS 17.X is based on the Visual Studio 2015 Isolated shell, which was released before Windows Server 2016. Microsoft takes app compatibility seriously and ensures that already-shipped applications continue to run on the latest Windows releases. To minimize issues running SSMS on Windows Server 2016, ensure SSMS has all of the latest updates applied. If you experience any issues with SSMS on Windows Server 2016, contact support. The support team determines if the issue is with SSMS, Visual Studio, or with Windows compatibility. The support team then routes the issue to the appropriate team for further investigation.	</description>

#### [SSMS 17.9](download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md)


Build number: 14.0.17285.0&lt;br&gt;
Release date: September 04, 2018

##### What&apos;s new

**General SSMS**


ShowPlan:

- Graphical Showplan now shows the new row mode memory grant feedback attributes when the feature is activated for a specific plan: IsMemoryGrantFeedbackAdjusted and LastRequestedMemory added to the MemoryGrantInfo query plan XML element. For more on row mode memory grant feedback, see [Adaptive query processing in SQL databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/adaptive-query-processing).

Azure SQL: 

- Added support for vCore SKUs in Azure DB creation. For more information, see [vCore-based purchasing model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-service-tiers#vcore-based-purchasing-model).
 

##### Bug fixes

**General SSMS**
	
Replication Monitor:

- Fixed an issue that was causing Replication Monitor (SqlMonitor.exe) not to start (User Voice item: https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/34791079) 

Import Flat File Wizard: 

- Fixed the link to the help page for &quot;Flat File Wizard&quot; dialog 
- Fixed issue where the wizard did not allow changing the destination table when the table already existed: this allows users to retry without having to exit the wizard, delete the failed table, and then reenter the information into the wizard (User Voice item: https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32896186). 

Import/Export Data-Tier Application:

- Fixed an issue (in DacFx) which was causing the import of a .bacpac could fail with a message like &quot;Error SQL72014: .Net SqlClient Data Provider: Msg 9108, Level 16, State 10, Line 1 This type of statistics is not supported to be incremental. &quot; when dealing with tables with partitions defined and no indexes on the table. 

Intellisense:

- Fixed an issue where intellisense completion was not working when using AAD with MFA. 

Object Explorer: 

- Fixed an issue where the &quot;Filter Dialog&quot; was displayed on random monitors instead of the monitor where SSMS was running (multi-monitor systems).

Azure SQL: 

- Fixed an issue related to enumeration of databases in the &quot;Available Databases&quot; where &quot;master&quot; was not displayed in the dropdown when connected to a specific database. 
- Fixed an issue where trying to generate a script (&quot;Data&quot; or &quot;Schema and Data&quot;) was failing then connected to the SQL Azure DB using AAD with MFA. 
- Fixed an issue in the View Designer (Views) where it was not possible to select &quot;Add Tables&quot; from the UI when connected to a SQL Azure DB. 
- Fixed an issue where SSMS Query Editor was silently closing and reopening connections during MFA token renewal. This will prevent side effects unbeknownst to the user (like closing a transaction and never reopening again) from happening. The change adds the token expiration time to the properties window. 
- Fixed an issue where SSMS was not enforcing password prompts for imported MSA accounts for AAD with MFA login. 

Activity Monitor: 

- Fixed a an issue that was causing &quot;Live Query Statistics&quot; to hang when launched from Activity Monitor and SQL Authentication was used. 

Microsoft Azure integration: 

- Fixed an issue where SSMS only shows the first 50 subscriptions (Always Encrypted dialogs, Backup/Restore from URL dialogs, etc…). 
- Fixed an issue where SSMS was throwing an exception (&quot;Index out of range&quot;) while trying to log on to an Microsoft Azure account which did not have any storage account (in Restore Backup from URL dialog). 

Object Scripting: 

- When scripting &quot;Drop and Create&quot;, SSMS now avoids generating dynamic T-SQL.
- When scripting a database object, SSMS now does not generate script to set database scoped configurations, if they are set to default values.

Help:

- Fixed a long outstanding issue where &quot;Help on Help&quot; was not honoring the online/offline mode.
- When clicking on &quot;Help | Community Projects and Samples&quot; SSMS now opens the default browser that points to a Git page and shows no errors/warnings due to old browser being used.

##### Known issues
