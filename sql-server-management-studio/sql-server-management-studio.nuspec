    <description>
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for accessing, configuring, managing, administering, and developing all components of SQL Server. SSMS combines a broad group of 
graphical tools with a number of rich script editors to provide developers and administrators of all skill levels access to SQL Server.  This release features improved compatibility with previous versions of SQL Server, 
a stand-alone web installer, and toast notifications within SSMS when new releases become available.

#### Version Number

This package is versioned using the published build number. The corresponding 'release number' is listed below in the Release Notes section.

#### Supported SQL Server versions

* This version of SSMS works with all [supported versions of SQL Server 2008 - SQL Server 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle?C2=1044) and provides the greatest level of support for working with the latest cloud features in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
* There is no explicit block for SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2005, but some features may not work properly.
* Additionally, SSMS 17.x can be installed side by side with SSMS 16.x or SQL Server 2014 SSMS and earlier. 

#### Supported Operating systems

This release of SSMS supports the following 64-bit platforms when used with the latest available service pack:
- Windows 10 (64-bit)
- Windows 8.1 (64-bit)
- Windows 8 (64-bit)
- Windows 7 (SP1) (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2016 *
- Windows Server 2012 R2 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2012 (64-bit)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit)

\* SSMS 17.X is based on the Visual Studio 2015 Isolated shell, which was released before Windows Server 2016. Microsoft takes app compatibility seriously and ensures that already-shipped applications continue to run on the latest Windows releases. To minimize issues running SSMS on Windows Server 2016, ensure SSMS has all of the latest updates applied. If you experience any issues with SSMS on Windows Server 2016, contact support. The support team determines if the issue is with SSMS, Visual Studio, or with Windows compatibility. The support team then routes the issue to the appropriate team for further investigation.	</description>

#### [SSMS 17.7](download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md)

Release number: 17.7&lt;br&gt;
Build number: 14.0.17254.0&lt;br&gt;
Release date: May 09, 2018

##### What&apos;s new

**General SSMS**

Replication Monitor:   
- Replication monitor now supports registering a listener for scenarios where publisher database and/or distributor database is part of Availability Group. You can now monitor replication environments where publisher database and/or distribution database is part of Always On. 
 
Azure SQL Data Warehouse: 
- Add Rejected Row Location support for External Tables in Azure SQL Data Warehouse. 

**Integration Services (IS)**

- Added a scheduling feature for SSIS packages deployed to Azure SQL Database. Unlike SQL Server on premises and SQL Database Managed Instance (Preview), which have SQL Server Agent as a first-class job scheduler, SQL Database does not have a built-in scheduler. This new SSMS feature provides a familiar user interface that&apos;s similar to SQL Server Agent for scheduling packages deployed to SQL Database. If you&apos;re using SQL Database to host the SSIS catalog database, SSISDB, you can use this SSMS feature to generate the Data Factory pipelines, activities, and triggers required to schedule SSIS packages. You can then edit and extend these objects in Data Factory. For more info, see [Schedule SSIS package execution on Azure SQL Database with SSMS](../integration-services/lift-shift/ssis-azure-schedule-packages-ssms.md). To learn more about Azure Data Factory pipelines, activities, and triggers, see [Pipelines and activities in Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities) and [Pipeline execution and triggers in Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers).
- Support for SSIS package scheduling in SQL Agent on SQL Managed instance. It is now possible to create SQL Agent jobs to execute SSIS packages on the managed instance. 

##### Bug fixes

**General SSMS** 

Maintenance Plan:   
- Fixed an issue where trying to change the schedule of an existing Maintenance Plan was throwing an exception. For details, see [SSMS 17.6 crashes when clicking on a schedule in a maintenance plan](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/33712924).

Always On: 
- Fixed an issue where Always On Latency Dashboard was not working with SQL Server 2012.
 
Scripting: 
- Fixed an issue where scripting stored procedure against Azure SQL Data Warehouse, is not working for non-admin user.
- Fixed an issue where scripting a database against Azure SQL Database was not scripting the *SCOPED CONFIGURATION* properties.
 
Telemetry: 
- Fixed issue where  SSMS crashes then trying to connect to a server, after opting out of sending telemetry.
 
Azure SQL Database: 
- Fixed an issue  where the user was not able to set or change compatibility level (the drop-down from empty). Note: in order to set the compatibility level to 150, the user still needs to use the *Script* button and manually edit the script. 
 
SMO: 
- Exposed Error Log Size setting in SMO. For details, see [Set the Maximum Size of the SQL Server Error Logs](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/33624115).  
- Fix linefeed scripting in SMO on Linux.
- Miscellaneous perf improvement when retrieving rarely used properties.  

Intellisense: 
- Perf improvement: reduced volume of intellisense queries for column data. This is especially beneficial when working on tables with huge number of columns. 

SSMS User settings:
- Fixed an issue where the options page was not resizing properly.

Misc:  
- Improved how text is displayed on *Statistics details* page. 

**Integration Services (IS)**

- Better support for Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.
- Fixed an issue where the user was unable to create a catalog for SQL Server 2014 or before.
- Fixed two issues with reports:
   - Removed the machine name for Azure servers.
   - Improved handling of localized object name.


##### Known issues

Some dialogs display an invalid edition error when working with new *General Purpose* or *Business Critical* Azure SQL Database editions.

(User suggestions [32911933](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32911933), and [32671051](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32671051).)

##### Bug fixes

**General SSMS**

Data Classification:

- Fixed an issue in *Data Classification* which was causing newly added classifications to be displayed with stale *information type* and *sensitivity label*.

Always On:

- Fixed an issue in AG Show Dashboard where clicking on *Collect Latency Data* could result in an error when the server was set to a case-sensitive collation.
- Fixed an issue where SSMS was incorrectly reporting an AG as *Distributed* when the Cluster service shuts down.
