    <description>
Designed for anyone from home users to large corporate environments that wish to View/Edit/Modify and even OCR Image based PDF files on their Windows PC's. There is now a FREE pdf reader alternative to the Adobe Reader that truly raises the bar! The PDF-XChange Editor is smaller, faster and more feature rich than any other FREE PDF Reader/ PDF Viewer/ PDF Editor available on the market. This free pdf editor download also allows users to try the extended functionality offered by the licensed PDF-XChange Editor in evaluation mode - for free. No PDF reader or Viewer offers more features than PDF-XChange - or does so without compromising performance, quality or security.
