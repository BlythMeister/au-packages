    <summary>Yet Another Favicon Downloader for KeePass 2.x</summary>
    <description>_Yet Another Favicon Downloader_ (_YAFD_ for short) is a plugin for _KeePass_ 2.x that allows you to quickly download favicons for your password entries.

### Features

- Concurrent and responsive (allows faster downloads without freezing the user interface)
- Lightweight and reliable (designed to download thousands of icons in batch)
- Smart and efficient
  - Avoids duplicate icons (reuses custom icons already present in the database)
  - Download entries without a URL scheme (automatically prefix URLs with `http://`)
- Linux support (_experimental_)
- Proxy support (respects _KeePass_ settings)
    </description>
    <releaseNotes>### Improvements

- Automatically adds https:// prefix to URLs while resolving the website address, if it fails try http:// as fallback.
(as suggested on pull request #31 by @firesoft-de)
