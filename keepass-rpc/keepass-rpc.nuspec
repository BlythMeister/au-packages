    <releaseNotes>Adds support for the multiple entry editing feature in KeePass 2.46.

In situations where there are different KeePassRPC configurations for the entries that are selected for editing, we now show a message in the Kee tab. Earlier versions of KeePassRPC would show an error message explaining that the configuration string is invalid.</releaseNotes>
